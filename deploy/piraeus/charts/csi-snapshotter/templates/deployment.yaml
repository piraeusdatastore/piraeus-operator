# This YAML file shows how to deploy the snapshot controller

  # The snapshot controller implements the control loop for CSI snapshot functionality.
  # It should be installed as part of the base Kubernetes distribution in an appropriate
  # namespace for components implementing base system functionality. For installing with
  # Vanilla Kubernetes, kube-system makes sense for the namespace.
