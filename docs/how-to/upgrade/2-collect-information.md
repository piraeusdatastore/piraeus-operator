# Collect Information before Performing the Upgrade

Before performing the upgrade and removing the old deployment, collect information on the state of your cluster.
This ensures the upgraded deployment will have a compatible configuration.

This is the second step when migrating Piraeus Operator from version 1 (v1) to version 2 (v2).
[Click here to get back to the overview](./index.md).

## Prerequisites

* [Install `kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* [Install `helm`](https://docs.helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* [Install `jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/)

## Run the Data Collection Script

To collect the necessary information for the migration, run the script provided at
`docs/how-to/upgrade/collect-operator-v1-information.sh`. You can run the script either from a checked out repository,
or directly from GitHub:

```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piraeusdatastore/piraeus-operator/v2/docs/how-to/upgrade/collect-operator-v1-information.sh \
  | bash -s
```

The script will ask you if you want to keep modifications made with the deployed Piraeus Operator.
For each modification, the script will show you the proposed change to the deployed resources and ask for
confirmation.

In addition, it will also inform you about values that cannot automatically be migrated, along with recommended
actions should you need to keep the modification. The output looks like this:

```

A copy of the identified resources is saved at `v2-resources.yaml`.

## Collect Helm-Generated Secrets

Helm automatically generates a passphrase for LINSTOR. Once LINSTOR is initialized with the passphrase, the LINSTOR
Controller will not be able fully start without supplying the passphrase.

To migrate the generated passphrase to Piraeus Operator v2, create a backup of the secret:

```
$ kubectl get secrets piraeus-op-passphrase -ogo-template='{{.data.MASTER_PASSPHRASE}}{{"\n"}}'
ZVRxanl1cVBscXV1ZTk1cmEwVTk5b0ptd0F4OGFmWlVPUVA0NWNnUw==
```

Save the generated passphrase for later use.
